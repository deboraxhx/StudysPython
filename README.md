## football_ 
Code to collect data from the [football-data](https://api.football-data.org/v4) api for the purpose of learning how to get data from the api and performing automatic updates to get new data. Of course, this code runs on a local machine, but it was designed for future application in a data processing platform such as Databriks with changes, of course.
